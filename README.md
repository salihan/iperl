iPerla enables interactive exploration of academic data. For lecturers, the dashboard offers insights into student performance, grade distribution, and engagement metrics. It provides tabs for diverse analyses, including identifying at-risk students. Meanwhile, the student dashboard empowers students with personalized assessment insights. Tabs showcase their overall performance, courses at risk, and domain-specific advice. These functions facilitate data-driven decision-making for educators and self-improvement for students, enhancing academic experiences.
